Working on why payload is currently smaller when i send a packet to the newer client
-network listener : readCallback commented out RSAdecoder(so we can use base 317 client)
-Player : LoginPlayer comment out the writeByte(0) if using newer client

Haven't got close to rewritting base. Lots of empty stuff/comments that i haven't cleaned up
